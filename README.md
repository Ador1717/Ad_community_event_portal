### Additional information

1. The registration process successfully adds users to the database; however, unfortunately, you are not able to log in using the credentials of newly registered users.
2. The feedback for reservations is not set correctly, but the reservation process is being completed successfully even though the feedback is incorrect.
3. The GET fetch API is working for newly created events, but it seems not to refresh the page automatically. However, the added event is visible without needing to refresh the page.
